Please make the following amendments to your request:
[DESCRIBE WHAT UPDATES ARE NEEDED].
Please hover your cursor over the blue (i) on the right hand side of the application screen, opposite exporter status. You comply with the definition of a manufacturer as detailed in the applicable legislation if you have had the products designed or manufactured and market them under your own name or trademark.

You can still list your contract manufacturer in the 'manufactured at' section if you want their details to be listed on the issued certificate. [DELETE IF NOT REQUIRED]
You must select the responsible person statement if your company has placed or will be placing these cosmetics products on the EU market. This statement confirms that your company is responsible for ensuring that the products meet the product safety requirements of the EU Cosmetics Regulation. [DELETE IF NOT COSMETICS]
The Responsible person statement does not refer to the person submitting the application, it refers to your company. [DELETE IF NOT COSMETICS]
You can only make the requested amendments using the update link found directly below the 'View Application' and 'Withdraw Application' links in the Actions column on the right hand side of your workbasket.
