        <h4 class="centre"><strong>CERTIFICATES OF FREE SALE (CFS) ISSUED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK)</strong></h4>
        <p>
            The Import Licensing Branch (ILB) is part of the Department for International Trade (DIT) in the United
            Kingdom (UK). We are responsible for the issue of Certificates of Free Sale (CFS) except in relation
            to food, drink and pesticides (Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - DEFRA),
            medicines and medical equipment (Medicines & Healthcare Regulatory Authority – MHRA) and
            biocides (Health & Safety Executive – HSE).
        </p>
        <p>
            I am writing to you to explain the changes that we have made to DIT issued CFS as a result of the UK
            leaving the EU. The DIT CFS inform regarding the listed products ability to be placed on the UK
            market.
        </p>
        <p>
            The security of the DIT CFS has been improved by upgrades to the QR code so that more information
            is available with which to confirm the validity of the DIT CFS. You are now able to download a copy of
            the issued CFS by using the QR code so you can do your own comparison if you have any concerns
            about the document presented. We believe that these changes make the CFS we issue one of the
            safest in the world and resilient to attempts to copy or manipulate an issued CFS. We hope that this
            will also remove any need to have any additional validation, e.g. by the UK’s Foreign &
            Commonwealth Development Office to confirm that the CFS was issued by a UK Government
            Department.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that due to the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol which impacts upon traders based
            in Northern Ireland in some instances both EU and UK legislation may be listed while traders based in
            Great Britain will only list UK legislation. An example of this is cosmetics legislation where the UK
            Cosmetics Regulation, Cosmetic Regulation No 1223/2009 as retained in UK law (which is based on
            retained EU legislation as established in the Withdrawal Agreement) will be listed for UK traders while
            those based in Northern Ireland will also have the EU cosmetic regulation, Regulation (EC) No
            1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic
            products, listed.
        </p>
        <p>
            These changes do not affect the safety of our products as all EU product safety law was introduced
            into UK law unchanged before we left the EU on 29th March 2019. Goods placed on the UK market
            continue to have to meet the strict product safety standards that applied when the UK was part of
            the EU. You can therefore be confident that the CFS we issue will continue to provide the
            assurance you want that our products are safe to be sold on your market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that previously issued CFS remain valid.
