The font size must be at least 1,6 mm unless the relevant component parts are too small to be marked to this size, in which case a smaller font size may be used. \nFor frames or receivers made from a non-metallic material, the marking should be applied to a metal plate that is permanently embedded in the material of the frame or receiver in such a way that the plate cannot be easily or readily removed; and removing the plate would destroy a portion of the frame or receiver.

The font size must be at least 1,6 mm unless the relevant component parts are too small to be marked to this size, in which case a smaller font size may be used. For frames or receivers made from a non-metallic material, the marking should be applied to a metal plate that is permanently embedded in the material of the frame or receiver in such a way that the plate cannot be easily or readily removed; and removing the plate would destroy a portion of the frame or receiver. Other techniques for marking such frames or receivers are permitted, provided those techniques ensure an equivalent level of clarity and permanence for the marking.</p>",
