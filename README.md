# ICMS - Import Case Management System

## Introduction

ICMS is "Import Case Management System", and this repo contains the Python /
Django / PostgreSQL port of it from the original Oracle-based system.

## Requirements

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Development only
  - [Docker Compose 1.21.0+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Setup

## Viewflow

ICMS uses the PRO version of [Viewflow](http://viewflow.io/) and in order to
fetch it from the private viewflow index `ICMS_VIEWFLOW_LICENSE` must be set.
Get it from [Rattic](https://rattic.ci.uktrade.digital/) ("Viewflow License
Key") and save it in `.env`:

    # use actual license number in place of <license_number>
    echo "ICMS_VIEWFLOW_LICENSE=<license_number>" > .env

`.env` file is ignored by git, make sure not to include this file in the
repository. It is only used locally.

## Local virtualenv

A local virtualenv is needed for a few reasons:

1. To be able to run the pre-commit checks
1. If using an IDE, so it has access to the library code and tooling

Note that the application is never actually run on the local machine while
developing, only within Docker.

## Initial setup

- `make build`
  - Build all Docker containers
- `make setup`
  - Create local virtualenv, set up pre-commit hooks, initialize database
- `make local_s3`
  - Create fake local S3 bucket. Local development uses
    [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) to emulate S3
    locally.

  - You will need aws cli tools installed and configured. If you have not done
    so run `aws configure`, the values don't really matter but aws cli won't run
    without a configuration file created.

  - The S3 bucket is named `icms.dev` on the localstack S3 instance. The
    localstack UI can be found on http://localhost:8081 and used to verify that
    the S3 bucket is created.

- `make createsuperuser`
  - Create user to login with

## Running the application

Start everything using docker-compose: `make debug`

Go to http://localhost:8080, login with the superuser account you created earlier.

Above script will start a PostgreSQL database and ICMS app in debug mode. In
order to run with no debug and Gunicorn server for a production-like environment
use: `make run`

Make sure to rebuild the Docker images if new dependencies are added to the
requirements files: `make build`.

## Code style

ICMS uses [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) for code formatting and
[flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for code analysis. Useful commands:

- `make black` - Check code is formatted correctly
- `make black_format` - Reformat all code
- `make flake8` - Check code quality is up to scratch

## Deployments

- Dev deployment Jenkins job: https://jenkins.ci.uktrade.digital/job/icms/
- ci-pipeline config: https://github.com/uktrade/ci-pipeline-config/blob/master/icms.yaml

## Business Processes

### Further Information Request Process

Further Information Request process (FIR) are sent by case officers to importers/exporters as part of various access requests, import/export applications.

A Further Information Request can not exist on it's own. It needs a parent process to be attached to.

In order to add FIR processes to a parent process follow the steps below. Examples are from `ImporterAccessRequestProcess`

-   Add `FurtherInformationProcessMixin` to your process model with a generic relation for FIR processes named `fir_processes`

```python
from web.domains.case.fir.mixins import FurtherInformationProcessMixin
from web.domains.case.fir.models import FurtherInformationRequestProcess

class ImporterAccessRequestProcess(FurtherInformationProcessMixin, Process):
	fir_processes = GenericRelation(FurtherInformationRequestProcess)
```

- Implement mixin's method interface to obtain necessary runtime data for the flow ( permissions, team, namespace etc.)

```python

def fir_config(self):
    """Returns configuration required for FIR processes to run.

        Example Config:

          {
            'requester_permission': 'web.IMP_CASE_OFFICER',
            'responder_permission': 'web.IMP_EDIT_APP',
            'responder_team': 'web.IMP_EDIT_APP',
            'namespace': 'access:importer'
          }"""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def fir_content(self, request):
        """Returns initial FIR content for requester to edit.

            Example:

            {
                'request_subject': 'subject',
                'request_detail': 'detail',
            }"""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def on_fir_create(self, fir):
        """Invoked when a new FIR process is started.
            Returns a FurtherInformationRequest instance

            Parameter: fir - New Furhter Information Request"""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

- Add FIR start and list urls to your process urls

```python

  from web.domains.case.fir.urls import fir_parent_urls

  importer_access_request_urls = FlowViewSet(ImporterAccessRequestFlow).urls
  importer_access_request_urls.extend(fir_parent_urls)

```

FIR views will be accessible with url name `<parent_process_namespace>:fir-list` and `<parent_process_namespace:fir-new>`.

In case of importer access requests it is `access:importer:fir-list` and `access:importer:fir-new`


## File Uploads
Files are uploaded directly to S3 without being saved into file system of the app. The app in turn sends the file to ClamAV for malware/virus checking. 

### Adding file upload component to your forms

#### Backend

Reusable `FileUploadMixin` can be used with `FormView`, in order to add file upload functionality to a form view follow these steps.

- Add mixin to your view and implement `get_file_queryset` method for initial list of files:
```python
from web.views.mixins import FileUploadMixin

class FurtherInformationRequestStartView(FileUploadMixin, FormView):
    def get_file_queryset(self):
        return self.get_form().instance.files
```
- Once form is submitted new file list will be available via `self.get_files()`, use this to link files to your objects
```python
    def form_valid(self, form):
        with transaction.atomic():
            fir = form.save()
            fir.files.set(self.get_files())
            return super().form_valid(form)
```
 
 #### Frontend
Reusable file macro can be used to add file uploader to your form as below:

```html
{% import "forms/files.html" as _files %}

{{ _files.uploader(files, field=form.fields.files, readonly=False) }}

```
